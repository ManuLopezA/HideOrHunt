# üéÆ‚ú® HIDE OR HUNT ‚ú®üéÆ

**‚ùá Hide or Hunt ‚ùá** is a demo of a multiplayer video game developed by **EstoEsUnaDemo**, a team consisting of Mart√≠ Comas, David G√≥mez, and myself: Manuel L√≥pez. 
We created this project as part of our final coursework for the Higher Education Degree in **Multiplatform Application Development with a specialization in Video Games** at **IES Sabadell**. 
Our development period spanned from April to June 2024.

## üìñ How to Play

1. **Choose Host or Client**: Select whether you want to be a HOST or a CLIENT. If you choose to be the HOST, you must share your IP address with the other participants.
2. **Set Up**: Choose a nickname and a character.
3. **Connect**: The HOST should connect first. Once you connect, the game will transition to the Lobby scene.
4. **In the Lobby Scene**: 
   - **Select Your Role**: Choose whether you want to be a Hider or a Hunter.
   - **Countdown**: After the HOST has connected, and the first CLIENT joins, a 30-second countdown will start. This countdown will prepare the game for the next stage.
5. **Map Selection**: After the countdown, you will be able to choose from different maps (note that in this version, only one map is available).
6. **Gameplay**: 
   - Hiders will have a brief period to hide once they enter the map.
   - Hunters must search for the Hiders throughout the map to eliminate them. Meanwhile, Hiders need to complete missions to avoid penalties!
