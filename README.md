# Hide or Hunt

**Hide or Hunt**❇ is a demo of a multiplayer video game developed by **EstoEsUnaDemo**, a team consisting of Martí Comas, David Gómez, and myself. We created this project as part of our final coursework for the Higher Education Degree in Multiplatform Application Development with a specialization in Video Games. Our development period spanned from April to June 2024.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Role**: Select whether you want to be a host or a client. If you are the host, you must connect to the game first and share your IP address with the other participants.
2. **Set Up**: Choose a nickname and a character.
3. **Connect**: The host must connect first. After that, the game will move to the Lobby scene where you need to choose your role: Hider or Hunter.
4. **Countdown**: Once the next player connects, a 30-second countdown will begin.
5. **Map Selection**: After the countdown, you will be able to choose from different maps (note that in this version, only one map is available).
6. **Gameplay**: 
   - Hiders will have a brief period to hide once they enter the map.
   - Hunters must search for the Hiders throughout the map to eliminate them. Meanwhile, Hiders need to complete missions to avoid penalties!
